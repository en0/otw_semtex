### Level 2 ? Level 3

Number-Lock Action
:You are almost on Semtex 4, there is just one big door before you. It is locked with a number lock.
:Analyze and use the locks in /semtex/semtex3 to adjust all the numbers in the correct way.
:They will open your way to the next level.

Tip :
:If you are not good at math, you should consider brute force. Rewrite the program and try all possible combinations of the locks. It wont take more than a few seconds ;)

### Reversed the logic of the lock.
1 =   5   2   1   7   5
2 =  13  -7  -4   1   5
3 =   9  12   9  70  -4
4 = -11   9   0   5 -13
5 =   4  17  12   9  24
6 =  11 -17  21   5  14
7 =  15  31  22 -12   3
8 =  19 -12   4   3  -7
